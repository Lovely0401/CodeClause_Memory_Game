## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Ready to play? Follow these simple steps to set up and run the game locally on your computer.

### Prerequisites

You'll need **Node.js** and **npm (Node Package Manager)** installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Create a new React project** (if you haven't already):

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app react-memory-game
    cd react-memory-game
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Install React's necessary packages along with Tailwind CSS:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

3.  **Configure Tailwind CSS:**

    Replace the content of your `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css` files with the code provided in the previous responses. This ensures Tailwind is set up correctly for the game's styles and animations.

4.  **Add the Game Code:**

    Recreate the following folder structure inside your `src` directory and copy-paste the corresponding code into each file. All the necessary code for these files was provided in our previous conversation:

    ```
    src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Card.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameInfo.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameOverModal.js
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MemoryGame.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ data/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cardIcons.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useMemoryGame.js
    â””â”€â”€ utils/
        â””â”€â”€ helpers.js
    ```

    * Make sure to replace the content of the existing `App.js` and `index.js` files with their simplified, refactored versions.

### Running the Game

Once all files are in place and saved, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your browser should automatically open a new tab at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port), and your memory game will be ready to play!

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1.  **Start:** The game board will appear with a grid of face-down cards.
2.  **Flip Cards:** Click on any card to reveal its hidden icon.
3.  **Find Pairs:** Click on a second card.
    * If the two cards have the **same icon**, it's a match! They'll stay face-up, and your score will increase.
    * If the icons are **different**, they're not a match. They'll flip back over after a brief delay, and your score will slightly decrease.
4.  **Score & Time:** Keep an eye on your **Score** and the **Time** counter at the top. The timer begins as soon as you flip your first card.
5.  **Win Condition:** The game concludes once you've successfully matched all the card pairs. A "Congratulations!" message will pop up, showcasing your final score and the time you took.
6.  **Play Again:** Simply click the "Reset Game" button (or "Play Again" on the win screen) to start a new round.
